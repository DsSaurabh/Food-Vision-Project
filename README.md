# Food-Vision-Project
We're going to be build Food Vision project (a transfer Learning model), using all of the data from the Food101 dataset (75,750 training images and 25,250 testing images). And our goal is beating DeepFood, a 2016 paper which used a Convolutional Neural Network trained for 2-3 days to achieve 77.4% top-1 accuracy.
